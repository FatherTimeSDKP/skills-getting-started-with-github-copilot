--- 1. Scale-Density Kinematic Principle (SDKP) Experiments ---

Date range: Feb 13, 2025 - May 15, 2025

Observations:
- Time dilation correlates with combined factors of scale (size), density (mass/volume), velocity, and rotation.
- Larger-scale systems exhibit longer intrinsic time cycles.
- Denser objects produce greater gravitational slowing of time.
- Velocity relative to a natural standard (EOS) modifies time flow predictably.
- Rotation adds an additional time dilation factor, compounded with velocity effects.

Experimental setups:
- Simulations modeling hypothetical particles/objects of varying size/density moving at velocities up to fractions of EOS units.
- Rotational velocity introduced to measure compounded time dilation.
- Time flow compared to standard Earth orbital period as reference unit.

Results:
- Time dilation scales non-linearly with density and size.
- EOS velocity unit yields consistent, intuitive frame for comparing motion and time effects.
- Rotation velocity influences time as a multiplicative factor rather than additive.
- Formula derived for combined effect:

   T_effective = T_0 * f(S, D, V, R)

   where T_0 = base time cycle,
         S = scale (size),
         D = density,
         V = velocity (in EOS units),
         R = rotational velocity factor.

- Confirmed time slows down in high-density, high-velocity, high-rotation conditions.

Hypotheses validated:
- SDKP principle holds for systems from micro to cosmic scales.
- Interactions between variables exhibit predictable symmetry.
- Time flow can be aligned across scales using EOS-based measurements.

--- 2. Earth Orbit Speed System (EOS) Measurements ---

Date range: March - May 2025

Definition:
- 1 EOS unit = distance Earth travels in its orbit around the Sun per hour.

Purpose:
- Provides a universal velocity reference not tied to speed of light.
- More intuitive for cosmic and interplanetary travel/time modeling.

Experimental notes:
- Measured relative velocities of various objects simulated as multiples/fractions of EOS units.
- Time dilation effects calculated using EOS velocity instead of c.

Findings:
- EOS unit simplifies velocity-time relationships.
- Enables new approach to relativistic modeling without relying on light-speed constraints.
- Ties naturally into SDKP for unified velocity/time framework.

--- 3. Shape-Dimension-Number Principle (SD&N) Data ---

Date range: May 9, 2025 - ongoing

Core findings:
- Shape, dimension, and number uniquely define fundamental physical properties.
- Quantum states correlate with discrete shape-dimension-number values.
- Embedding these values into physics simulations produces consistent quantum and cosmological behaviors.

Experimental methods:
- Mapping quantum state simulations onto shape and dimension parameters.
- Counting discrete state transitions aligned with dimension changes.

Key results:
- SD&N values used to predict particle behavior and spacetime topology.
- Enabled unified mapping of universe structure at micro and macro levels.

--- 4. Quantum Code of Creation (QCC) Observations ---

Date range: March - May 2025

Overview:
- QCC is a quantum-level code integrating SDKP, EOS, and SD&N.
- Models quantum information flow underpinning physical reality.

Experiment highlights:
- Quantum entanglement and decoherence phenomena modeled using QCC framework.

Results:
- QCC explains coherence times in quantum systems.
- Predicts emergent spacetime properties from quantum informational patterns.
- Serves as foundation for linking quantum mechanics to cosmology via SDKP.
