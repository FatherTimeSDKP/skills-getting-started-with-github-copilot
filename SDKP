===========================

Date Range: February 13, 2025 – May 15, 2025

Objective:
- To validate how size (scale), density, velocity, and rotation influence the flow of time and kinematic behavior.

Experimental Setup:
- Simulations of objects with varied scale (size) and density values.
- Velocity introduced as multiples of EOS (Earth Orbit Speed) units.
- Rotational velocity added as a factor in time dilation measurements.
- Time flow compared to a baseline reference time cycle (T_0), derived from Earth orbital period units.

Key Observations:
- Time dilation increases with:
   * Higher density (mass/volume ratio).
   * Larger scale systems (macroscopic objects).
   * Increased velocity relative to EOS.
   * Greater rotational velocity.
- Combined effects are multiplicative, not simply additive.

Derived Formula:

   T_effective = T_0 × f(S, D, V, R)

   where:
   - T_effective = observed time flow for system
   - T_0 = baseline time cycle (Earth orbit hour base)
   - S = Scale factor (relative size)
   - D = Density factor (mass/volume)
   - V = Velocity factor (in EOS units)
   - R = Rotation velocity factor (angular velocity influence)

Simulation Results:
- Increasing density from 1x to 10x standard baseline slows time flow proportionally.
- Velocity effects showed a consistent non-linear increase in time dilation starting at 0.1 EOS units.
- Rotation effects compounded velocity-based time dilation by up to 15% at high angular velocities.
- Large-scale, high-density, high-velocity, and fast-rotating systems experienced maximum predicted time dilation, matching theoretical expectations.

Conclusions:
- SDKP’s multidimensional approach accurately models time dilation beyond classical relativistic approaches.
- EOS-based velocity units provide a natural, intuitive measurement system.
- Rotation as a factor in time dilation is significant and must be included in models.
- Confirmed that time dilation effects scale predictably across physical scales.

Additional Notes:
- Timestamp data for experiments is blockchain-anchored (NFT linked) for proof of authorship.
- SDKP principle validated for universal application from quantum scales to astrophysics.
