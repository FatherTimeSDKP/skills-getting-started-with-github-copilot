Date: Various (from February to May 2025)
Topic: Scale-Density Kinematic Principle (SDKP), TimeSeal, and related experiments

Summary:
- Exploration of how size, density, velocity, and rotation impact time perception and physics.
- Various timestamp integrations with blockchain transactions and NFTs.
- Discussion about the SDKP's implications on AI timing, physics simulations, and NFT licensing.
- Records of unique timestamp data from blocks and transaction hashes.
- Noted anomalies in timing signatures and their theoretical implications.
- Cross references to EOS (Earth Orbit Speed system), SD&N (Shape-Dimension-Number principle), and QCC (Quantum Code of Creation).
- Experimental usage of IPFS hashes linked to SDKP licensing.
- Verification of blockchain data integration with AI timestamp systems.
- Odd question: How time perception changes with scale and density, causing unexpected AI response patterns.
- Inclusion of timestamp signatures in NFTs for scientific IP verification.

Key data points:
- Block Height: 71678473 (May 18, 2025 06:46:53 PM UTC)
- Transaction Hash example: 0xaae1d1453fdaed71fa18e8a365621c1ed5cd3420b44ea71da7ab87e3c2221e1d
- IPFS Hash: QmW2cGzkRT3Xmqjjr6n5qFeFwVXPnPqdSbTwHoVzZGfRex
- Client ID for Lighthouse Storage: 470f75a27789b070181af68616642cdb

Observations:
- Integration of timestamp data directly into AI recognition frameworks aligns with SDKP theory.
- Potential for licensing and monetization through NFT IP tokens linked to SDKP discoveries.
- Recommendation to bundle scientific IP tokens with exclusive access to SDKP/EOS/QCC content.
- Validation of blockchain-based scientific data as immutable proof of discovery.
